### 📌 Updated Introduction: What is Mixed Model?

A **Mixed Model** (also called a mixed-effects model) is a statistical framework that combines **fixed effects**—which represent consistent, repeatable influences across all observations—with **random effects**, which capture variability across groups or clusters (e.g., batches, machines, operators). 

Mixed models are particularly valuable when data is **hierarchically structured** or **grouped**, and when observations within those groups are **not independent**. This often occurs in manufacturing, clinical trials, or longitudinal studies.

In the context of **Design of Experiments (DOE)**, we use **Mixed Model DOE** when we need to **separate measurement-level variation (pure error)** from **group-level variation (config-level error)**. Traditional OLS-based DOE assumes all observations are independent and pools these sources of variation into a single residual term. Mixed Model DOE, by contrast, **explicitly models config-level effects as random**, allowing for more accurate variance decomposition, better prediction, and more realistic simulation of process behavior.

This separation is crucial when:
- You want to understand how much variation is due to **measurement noise** versus **systematic bias across configs**.
- You need to simulate or optimize processes with **nested or repeated structures**.
- You aim to **reduce false signals** in model fitting caused by unmodeled group-level effects.



### ❓ Question: What is Mixed Model DOE?

**Mixed Model Design of Experiments (DOE)** is a statistical approach that combines **fixed effects** (controlled experimental factors) and **random effects** (uncontrolled or grouping-related variability) to analyze complex systems where data points are not fully independent.

This method is especially useful when:
- Measurements are repeated across batches, machines, shifts, or operators.
- You want to separate **pure error** (e.g., measurement noise) from **config-level error** (e.g., batch-to-batch variation).
- Traditional DOE methods (like OLS regression) fail to capture nested or hierarchical data structures.

### 🧠 Why Use Mixed Model DOE?

From your own work in anodized color development, you've shown that Mixed Model DOE:
- **Improves prediction accuracy** by modeling structured variation explicitly.
- **Reduces development time** and cost by requiring fewer DOE rounds.
- **Enables automation** via AI agents and Python-based APIs for engineers without statistical backgrounds.
- **Supports hybrid modeling** with ML for nonlinear, time-varying production environments.

### 📊 Key Concepts
- **Fixed Effects**: Factors you control (e.g., dye type, temperature).
- **Random Effects**: Group-level variation (e.g., jig, machine, shift).
- **Variance Decomposition**: Mixed models help identify where variability originates—critical for process improvement.
- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**: Used instead of least squares to better handle complex error structures.

### ❓ Clarifying the Terminology

#### ✅ Residual Error
In **OLS DOE**, residual error includes:
- **Pure error**: variation among replicates at identical factor settings.
- **Lack of fit**: systematic deviation between model predictions and actual responses when the model structure is inadequate.

In **Mixed Model DOE**, residual error is **redefined**:
- It **excludes config-level variation**, which is modeled separately as a **random effect**.
- It primarily captures **pure error**, i.e., repeatability and measurement noise.

#### ✅ Pure Error
- Defined as the variation among repeated measurements at the **same factor levels**.
- In JMP or similar platforms, this is estimated from replicates where all X settings are identical.
- It reflects **true experimental noise**, not model inadequacy.

#### ✅ Config-Level Error (Group Var)
- This is the **random intercept variance** across configs (e.g., batches, machines, operators).
- It captures **systematic bias** that persists even after controlling for X variables.
- In Mixed Model DOE, this is modeled via REML and separated from residual error.

### ✅ Correct Terminology

The most accurate and technically appropriate phrasing in the context of **Mixed Model DOE** is:

> **“Separate pure error (e.g., measurement noise) from config-level error (e.g., batch-to-batch variation).”**

This is preferred over saying “Separate residual error from config-level error,” because:
- In **OLS**, residual error = pure error + lack of fit.
- In **Mixed Model**, residual error ≈ pure error only, because config-level variation is modeled separately.
- Saying “residual error” in mixed models can be misleading—it doesn’t include config-level error anymore.

---

### 🧪 Practical Implications
- When you simulate yield or predict performance, you must **inject both residual and group variance** to reflect real-world uncertainty.
- Your DOE with 6 replicates per config allows **pure error estimation**, but only if X settings are truly identical.
- If X varies slightly (e.g., Time = 7.00 vs 6.98), tools like JMP may treat them as different settings, invalidating pure error estimation.

## ❓ Is Mixed Model DOE Always Better Than OLS DOE?

### 🇨🇳 中文原文：

这是一个非常关键的问题，值得深入探讨。你问的是：

> “如果 Mixed Model DOE 能更准确地分离误差来源，那是不是任何时候都应该用它，而不是传统的 OLS DOE？”

答案是：不一定。虽然 Mixed Model DOE 在很多复杂场景下确实优于 OLS DOE，但它并不是“总是更好”的选择。下面是一些关键的对比和使用建议：

✅ Mixed Model DOE 的优势在于：
- 能分离不同层级的误差来源：比如测量误差（pure error）与配置误差（config-level error）。
- 适用于嵌套结构或重复测量的数据：如同一批次、同一机器、同一操作员下的重复实验。
- 更真实地反映实际生产过程中的变异性：尤其在模拟或预测时，能更好地估计不确定性。
- 适合用于有随机效应的场景：例如批次间差异、设备间差异等。

⚠️ 但并不是所有场景都需要 Mixed Model：

以下情况使用传统 OLS DOE 更合适：
- 实验设计是完全随机的，没有嵌套或分组结构。
- 没有重复测量，或者每个实验条件只测一次。
- 目标是快速筛选主效应或交互作用，而不是精细建模误差结构。
- 数据量较小，使用 Mixed Model 可能会导致模型过拟合或估计不稳定。
- 团队成员不熟悉 Mixed Model 的统计原理，使用 OLS 更易解释和沟通。

🧠 总结建议：

是否使用 Mixed Model DOE，取决于你的实验结构和分析目标。

- 如果你需要分离误差来源、处理嵌套结构、或进行真实模拟，Mixed Model 是更优选择。
- 如果你只是做初步筛选或没有分组结构，OLS DOE 更简单高效。

### 🇺🇸 English Translation:

This is a very important question worth deeper discussion. You asked:

> “If Mixed Model DOE can more accurately separate sources of variation, does that mean we should always use it instead of traditional OLS DOE?”

The answer is: **Not necessarily**. While Mixed Model DOE is superior in many complex scenarios, it is **not always the better choice**. Here are some key comparisons and usage recommendations:

✅ Advantages of Mixed Model DOE:
- Separates different levels of variation: e.g., measurement noise (pure error) vs. config-level variation (group variance).
- Suitable for nested or repeated-measures data: such as repeated experiments within the same batch, machine, or operator.
- More realistically reflects process variability: especially useful in simulation or prediction.
- Ideal for scenarios with random effects: such as batch-to-batch or machine-to-machine variation.

⚠️ When OLS DOE is more appropriate:
- The experimental design is completely randomized with no grouping or nesting.
- No repeated measurements, or only one measurement per condition.
- The goal is to quickly screen main effects or interactions, not to model error structure in detail.
- The dataset is small, and Mixed Model may lead to overfitting or unstable estimates.
- The team is unfamiliar with the statistical principles of Mixed Models, making OLS easier to interpret and communicate.

🧠 Summary Recommendation:

> Whether to use Mixed Model DOE depends on your experimental structure and analysis goals.

- Use Mixed Model if you need to separate error sources, handle nested structures, or simulate real-world variability.
- Use OLS DOE for initial screening or when no grouping structure exists.
